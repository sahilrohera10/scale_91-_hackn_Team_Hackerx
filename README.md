We aim to revolutionize the banking experience through a mobile app that addresses two critical challenges. Firstly, we propose 'Instant Virtual Card Issuance upon Approval,' allowing users immediate access to a virtual card for seamless transactions while awaiting their physical card. This ensures users can transact without delays, enhancing their banking convenience. Secondly, we introduce a 'Credit Score Validator' within the app, offering real-time insights into users' creditworthiness.
